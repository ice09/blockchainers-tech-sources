Once you created a Token, you will want to distribute it. To distribute it fairly from the beginning, Airdrops are a often chosen means to distribute Tokens. Airdrops can be "push" or "pull", for "push" Tokens are just sent to addresses following certain criteria (eg. having an ETH balance), "pull" creates a list of possible addresses and let the owners check for inclusion.  
"Push" Airdrop however have some severe disadvantages.

* Unsolicited Tokens are wrong.
  * They might be even illegal in certain jurisdictions.
  * They can raise tax issues.
  * Technically, they are spam.
* Though the distribution might be fair, as the recipient does not know the Token, it might be useless to her.
  * If I don't know how to use the Token, most likely I don't use it.
  * For Utility Tokens, depending on the kind of service, non-targetted Airdrops will most likely fail.

"Pull" Airdrops have a two variants:

* Compile a list of pre-selected addresses.
* Let users claim Tokens by registering their addresses.

The last variant seems to most feasible one, _any_ user (not just pre-selected ones) can register for the Token (as in opt-in). This reverses the selection process which makes more sense for user acquisition, marketing reasons, business development etc. 

However, there is one big problem, which is eminent for all kind of non-permissioned, anonymous networks: sybil attacks. As we do not know who is requesting the Tokens, one user could just generate 1000 addresses with 1000 claims and it would be impossible to know.
